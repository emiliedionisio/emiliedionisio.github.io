## 🚀 About Me

With over 7+ years of experience in Technical and Desktop Support and 3 years of Network Administration experience for small businesses, I possess strong skills in computer hardware and software installation, repair, and maintenance. I excel at identifying and resolving complex technical issues and implementing effective security measures to troubleshoot vulnerabilities.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge and skills in Cybersecurity and AWS Cloud Computing. Through extensive lab practice and 400+ hours of technical instruction in cybersecurity, I have gained expertise in building VPC and subnets with EC2, routing tables, security groups, and creating a LAMP stack with WordPress in AWS, and more. In addition, I collaborated with a team to design and implement a secure virtual environment to demonstrate our expertise in cybersecurity and AWS cloud infrastructure. We created a comprehensive security lab on a local machine by installing Linux servers with security tools and successfully replicated the entire environment in AWS, ensuring secure deployment in the cloud.

As a proactive and self-motivated individual, I am highly efficient in providing exceptional customer service. I possess a natural ability to quickly learn new skills and find innovative solutions to complex problems. With a strong commitment to professional development, I continuously strive to enhance my skills and knowledge, delivering effective solutions to any challenge that may arise.
