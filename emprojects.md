# Phase 1 TKH Project
## Project Title: Designed and implemented a secure network infrastructure

### Project Description: <br />
I designed and implemented a secure network infrastructure consisting of three Windows 10 host machines and one Mac OS X host machine. A virtual box was installed on each host machine. They were all connected to the switch behind the router. They were separated from the main network and used different private IP address pools on their own subnet. This lab demonstrated a secure network infrastructure that incorporated various technologies and techniques to protect against potential threats.

The first host machine, with two Ubuntu servers, had Splunk and Suricata installed for monitoring and security purposes. Splunk is a tool that can be used to collect and analyze large amounts of data, while Suricata is an intrusion detection system that can be used to detect malicious traffic.

The second host machine had a cluster of three Ubuntu servers, isolated from the main network and connected through SSH. Kali Linux was installed to act as an attacker for the weak machines within the network. Kali Linux is a penetration testing distribution that can be used to simulate attacks on a network.

The third host machine had a pfSense firewall installed and configured as the main firewall for the network. pfSense is a free and open-source firewall software that can be used to protect a network from unauthorized access.

The fourth host machine was used for testing, with the installation of metasploitable and Windows 7 as weak virtual machines to be exploited. Metasploitable is a vulnerable Linux distribution that can be used to test the effectiveness of security controls. Windows 7 is a popular operating system that is often targeted by attackers.

The project demonstrated the importance of creating a secure network infrastructure and the various tools and techniques available to achieve that. The project also demonstrated the importance of using a variety of security controls to protect a network from unauthorized access.
