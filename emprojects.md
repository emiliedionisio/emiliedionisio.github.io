# Phase 1 TKH Project
CYBERSECURITY PROJECT https://www.swishnode.com/emilie/projects/emiliedionisio_tkhphase1project.pdf)
- Designed and implemented a network infrastructure consisting of three Windows 10 host machines and one Mac OS X host machine. A virtual box is installed on each host machine. They are all connected to the switch behind the router. They are separated from the main network and use different private IP address pools on their own subnet. This lab demonstrated a secure network infrastructure that incorporated various technologies and techniques to protect against potential threats.
- The first host machine, with two Ubuntu servers, had Splunk and Suricata installed for monitoring and security purposes. 
- The second host machine had a cluster of three Ubuntu servers, isolated from the main network and connected through SSH. Kali Linux was installed to act as an attacker for the weak machines within the network. 
- The third host machine had a pfSense firewall installed and configured as the main firewall for the network, with an Ubuntu Desktop for GUI-based configuration. 
- The fourth host machine was used for testing, with the installation of metasploitable and Windows 7 as weak virtual machines to be exploited. The project demonstrated the importance of creating a secure network infrastructure and the various tools and techniques available to achieve that.
