### Phase 1 Project



In my cybersecurity phase 1 project, I took measures to implement cybersecurity practices within the lab environment. I incorporated Ubuntu Servers with Suricata and Splunk, as well as PfSense with Snort, to enhance the security of the network. These tools enabled me to monitor network traffic, detect potential threats, and analyze log data for security purposes.

By utilizing Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), I could actively monitor the network for any suspicious activities or malicious behavior. Splunk, on the other hand, served as a powerful log management and analysis tool, allowing me to centralize and analyze security-related logs for identifying potential security incidents.

Furthermore, I integrated PfSense with Snort, an open-source network intrusion prevention system (IPS), to provide an additional layer of security to the network. Snort aided in detecting and preventing network intrusions and malicious activities by analyzing network traffic in real-time.

Through the implementation of these cybersecurity tools, I aimed to create a secure lab environment that mirrored real-world scenarios. It allowed me to gain practical experience in detecting and mitigating potential threats, thereby strengthening my understanding of cybersecurity concepts and enhancing my skills as a future cybersecurity professional.
