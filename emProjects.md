In my cybersecurity phase 1 project, I took measures to implement cybersecurity practices within the lab environment. I incorporated Ubuntu Servers with Suricata and Splunk, as well as PfSense with Snort, to enhance the security of the network. These tools enabled me to monitor network traffic, detect potential threats, and analyze log data for security purposes.

By utilizing Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), I could actively monitor the network for any suspicious activities or malicious behavior. Splunk, on the other hand, served as a powerful log management and analysis tool, allowing me to centralize and analyze security-related logs for identifying potential security incidents.

Furthermore, I integrated PfSense with Snort, an open-source network intrusion prevention system (IPS), to provide an additional layer of security to the network. Snort aided in detecting and preventing network intrusions and malicious activities by analyzing network traffic in real-time.

Through the implementation of these cybersecurity tools, I aimed to create a secure lab environment that mirrored real-world scenarios. It allowed me to gain practical experience in detecting and mitigating potential threats, thereby strengthening my understanding of cybersecurity concepts and enhancing my skills as a future cybersecurity professional.

The primary objective of this project was to learn how to build and configure a website from scratch using the LAMP stack and AWS. Additionally, we aimed to demonstrate our knowledge and skills acquired during Phase 1, particularly in security, and apply what we've learned in Phase 2 regarding AWS. Through this WordPress website, we can showcase our individual skills while also working together as a team and learning from one another.

**Project Focus:** Our focus throughout the project was on individual skills development while working collaboratively as a team. We accomplished this by creating our own environments, allowing us to showcase what we could do independently while also receiving support and guidance from our team members.

**Project Challenges:** Throughout the project, we conducted daily meetings, including some off-hours, to explore different options for building our website. Due to the time spent creating and building VPCs, subnets, and EC2s, as well as the risk of exceeding our free tier account limits, we opted not to use a shared account. In fact, some team members were charged a small amount for exceeding their free tier usage, as we spent a significant amount of time building and rebuilding the environment. Additionally, instances were sometimes left running, causing issues when the instance was restarted.

**Project Solutions:** To avoid these issues, we created our own individual environments within our respective AWS accounts. This allowed us to work independently, while also collaborating as a team. In this report, you will find detailed project descriptions for each team member, including information on how we built our respective parts of our project.

**Project Tools:** To support our collaborative efforts, we utilized a range of tools, including Zoom, Google Meet, Google Workspace (Share Drive), Jira, Slack Private Channel, and Huddle. These tools facilitated communication and allowed us to work efficiently as a team.
